Heap Displasia Detection (HDC)
==============================

The objective of this ML project is to predict whether or not an RX image of a heap represents a positive HDC case.

How to setup project
-------------

NOTE: Python version used in development stage: 3.10.0.
Commands can slightly vary depending on your OS

On main directory, type:
- ``py -m venv .env``
- ``.\.env\Scripts\activate``
- ``py -m pip install --upgrade pip``
- ``pip install -r .\requirements.txt``

Once the dependencies are installed:
- To run the notebook, select the environment as kernel and run the cells sequentially
- The makefile contains all commands to run the project processes.
    - If you cant run the makefile with your IDE you can copy the command and run it in the console. As an example: ``py src/data/make_dataset.py data/raw/train.csv data/interim/house-train.joblib data/interim/house-test.joblib data/interim/house-validation.joblib``
